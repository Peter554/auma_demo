This is just a simple demonstration of an early version of the Augmented Audio (auma) framework.

The demo shows the combination of audio with time-synced illustrations and simple interactions.

Augmented Audio is an effort to develop Audiopedia into an e-Learning framework for low-resource settings, specifically for marginalized, often illiterate populations in the Global South. However, there are many more use cases for the Augmented Audio framework.

Also testing deployment to auma.io through IONOS Deploy Now.
