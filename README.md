# Augmented Audio Framework Demo

This is just a simple demonstration of an early version of the Augmented Audio (auma) framework.

The demo shows the combination of audio with time-synced illustrations and simple interactions.

Augmented Audio is an effort to develop Audiopedia into an e-Learning framework for low-resource settings, specifically for marginalized, often illiterate populations in the Global South. However, there are many more use cases for the Augmented Audio framework.

Also testing deployment to https://auma.io through IONOS Deploy Now.
